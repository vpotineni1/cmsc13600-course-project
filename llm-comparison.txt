My data model differs from the AI-generated one because I added a little more detail and functionality including explicit role and media tables,likes,dislikes, and clearer field names.
I preferred that my version seperates user roles and connects post/comments explicitly, which makes moderation easier. I liked that the AI code was cleaner, and utilized Django conventions better.
However, it missed features such as post statistics, and explicit media content fields which is important for restrictions. Overall, the AI model was very clean and concise, although my code was a little more specific and detailed.
